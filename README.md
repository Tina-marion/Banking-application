# Banking-application GROUP2
This project is a secure, modular, and scalable banking application developed using Python and structured using Clean Architecture principles. The system allows the creation and management of checking and savings accounts, supporting core banking functionalities such as deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history tracking.

üöÄ Features
The Banking App offers a comprehensive set of core features designed to provide users with a seamless and secure banking experience. Users can create either checking or savings accounts, and perform deposits and withdrawals while adhering to predefined rule-based constraints‚Äîsuch as preventing overdrafts on savings accounts. The application allows users to view their current balance and transaction history in real time. Built with clean, modular, and testable domain and application layers, the system is structured for easy maintenance and scalability. It includes basic unit tests written pytest, and exposes RESTful API endpoints using modern Python frameworks like FastAPI or Flask. For data storage, the app initially uses in-memory Python dictionaries, with support for SQLite integration.

üèÜ Contributors The project was developed by the following contributors: NUWEISAH ISAIAH (23/U/26082/PS), ABWOR TINA MARION (23/U/04872/EVE),  NALUWAGA JOY DRICILLA (23/U/14160/EVE) and ASIIMWE EMMANUEL (23/U/06558/PS). 

üì¶ Project Setup 
The backend is built using FastAPI , to enable efficient and scalable RESTful API development.The architecture follows a Clean Architecture model, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns across layers (domain, application, service, and presentation layers). For data storage, the application starts with in-memory solutions and integrates SQLite for persistent storage. Testing is handled using pytest frameworks to ensure code quality and reliability.
