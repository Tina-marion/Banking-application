# Banking-application
This project is a secure, modular, and scalable banking application developed using Python and structured using Clean Architecture principles. The system supports the creation and management of checking and savings accounts, along with functionalities to deposit, withdraw, and view transaction histories. It also follows a multi-layered architecture separating domain logic, services, data access, and presentation (API) layers.

üöÄ Features
The Banking App offers a comprehensive set of core features designed to provide users with a seamless and secure banking experience. Users can create either checking or savings accounts, and perform deposits and withdrawals while adhering to predefined rule-based constraints‚Äîsuch as preventing overdrafts on savings accounts. The application allows users to view their current balance and transaction history in real time. Built with clean, modular, and testable domain and application layers, the system is structured for easy maintenance and scalability. It includes basic unit tests written using either unittest or pytest, and exposes RESTful API endpoints using modern Python frameworks like FastAPI or Flask. For data storage, the app initially uses in-memory Python dictionaries, with support for SQLite integration. All development is managed using GitHub for version control, enabling efficient team collaboration and code tracking.

üèÜ Contributors The project was developed by the following contributors: NUWEISAH ISAIAH (23/U/26082/PS), ABWOR TINA MARION (23/U/04872/EVE),  NALUWAGA JOY DRICILLA (23/U/14160/EVE) and ASIIMWE EMMANUELA. Each team member played a crucial role in the development of the app, from design to implementation.

üì¶ Project Setup 
The backend is built using FastAPI or Flask, providing robust support for RESTful API development. The architecture follows a clean, domain-driven, layered structure to ensure maintainability and scalability. For data storage, the application starts with in-memory solutions and integrates SQLite for persistent storage. Testing is handled using Python‚Äôs unittest or pytest frameworks to ensure code quality and reliability. Git is used for version control, with GitHub serving as the central repository for collaboration and source tracking. Additionally, all project tasks, timelines, and progress are managed through ClickUp to streamline team coordination and enable transparent monitoring by instructors.
